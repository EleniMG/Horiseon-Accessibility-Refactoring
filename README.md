# Horiseon-Accessibility-Refactoring

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to improve accessibility when using this site, not only for consumers but also for fellow developers. When working on this project, I fixed one of the links in the navigation bar by including an ID from the corresponding article at the bottom of the homepage. I improved accessibility by including semantic HTML elements, amending the title element which names the webpage tab, and added alternative text for all images and icons. In doing the latter, I learned to include an aria-label in order to name the background image which had been inserted using CSS.
